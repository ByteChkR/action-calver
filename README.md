## Inputs

### `version_prefix`

String to prefix the version string with. Default `""`.

### `default_branch`

Name of the default branch(es). For builds from other branches, the branch name is used as a pre-release suffix in the environment variable and output. Default `refs/heads/main`. Define multiple branches by seperating them with `|`.

### `format`

**Required** Day.js compatible date format string.
Default `YY.M.D`. Below is a table of formats and what their output version would be for the date 2022-10-09 with a build number of 1. Notice that the first one has 4 parts and others have 3 parts.
